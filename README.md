Made the google home page. Kind of difficult, still don't know 100% how to 
position divs at the center of the page. The google image in particular had this problem
where the margins wouldn't get all the way to the border of the page, and
when I did margin-auto it would not position the image at the exact center.
Solved it by adding padding.
